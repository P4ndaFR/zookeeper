# A log configuration that routes ZooKeeper messages to an external file.

# This file is used for explicit configuration of the Log4J library, as opposed to implicit configuration at startup, hence
# the use of a non-standard resource name.
#
# Note that both `zk.log` and `zk.level` must be assigned as system properties, otherwise configuration will fail.
